# DynWebProject - WebChat
## Authors: Daniel Schaberreiter / Bernhard Kober

## General

Simple chat application, which transmits messages from one client to all others. The only special node.js module used is socket.io, it allows us to create a socket connection between the server and clients and call events and send data back and forth. Further modules were used!

## Requirements

* NodeJs
* Set up MongoDB

## Installation

1. Start MongoDB
2. npm install (to install all modules from the dependencies file)
3. Browser -> 127.0.0.1:8080

## How does the application work?

1. SignUp - by clicking the SignUp button and enter a valid e-mail (FH Mail) & password!
2. Check your mailbox - you will get a verification mail with a token, copy the token!
3. Enter the token to complete your registration!
4. Start to chat!

## Further ideas

* Online user list
* Private chats
